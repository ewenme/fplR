## Overview

fplr makes it quick 'n' easy to retrieve [Fantasy Premier League](https://fantasy.premierleague.com) (FPL) data programmatically, then work with it, all from R. 

## Installation

Get the latest development version of `fplr` from GitHub.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ewenme/fplr")
```

Because of the lack of dev support from FPL and possible API changes, the package is unlikely to be submitted to CRAN and will remain in an experimental [lifecycle](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/) for the foreseeable future.

## Usage

Refer to the [quickstart guide](https://ewenme.github.io/fplr/articles/fplr-quickstart.html) to get started. 
Still, here are some very basic examples of the functionality and practical applications of `fplr`.

### Get data

...on all players in the current FPL season.

```{r}
library(fplr)

players <- fpl_get_player_all()

players
```
