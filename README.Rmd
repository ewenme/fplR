[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ewenme/fplr.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ewenme/fplr) 
[![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)

An R package housing a compendium of tools for working with [Fantasy Premier League](https://fantasy.premierleague.com) (FPL) data in R. 

## Installation

Get the latest development version of `fplr` from GitHub: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!require(remotes)) {
  install.packages("remotes") 
  }

# install package
remotes::install_github("ewenme/fplr")
```

Because of the lack of dev support from FPL and possible API changes, the package is unlikely to be submitted to CRAN and will remain in an experimental [lifecycle](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/) for the foreseeable future.

## Usage

Refer to the [quickstart guide](https://ewenme.github.io/fplr/articles/fplr-quickstart.html) to get started. Here are some very basic examples of the functionality inside `fplr`.

Get data on all players in the current FPL season:

```{r}
library(fplr)

fpl_get_player_all()
```

Get data on a user's FPL season performances:

```{r}
fpl_get_user_season(user_id = 123)
```
